I am a software engineer & architect at Itemis in Stuttgart. Before I joined Itemis, I have worked several years in domain of automation engineering and embedded devices where my main focus was software architecture and modeling.  Beside that I have worked as a consultant for modeling and helped modeling execution and data flows in distributed system. My main focus is on software architecture and model driven software development.

I spent most of my spare time with kayaking, playing around with my arduino or other embedded boards to create awesome home automation gadgets and recently starting glider flying.
