This post ist about the server part of the trainmonitor project.

The server is wirtten in C# and uses a wrapper around the HttpListener provided by the BCL to avoid a bunch of the overhead an IIS /mod_monoÂ envoriment would add. Currently the wrapper is thin but it is under heavy development, the long term goal is to provide a declarative way to model the REST-full serivce infrastructure, with heavy usage of AOP mechanisms. From the architeture perspective the HTTP interface is locate at the highest layer where you would typical locate a UI, this is done since the JSON output of the server is just another representation of the server resources, this will be essential when a Web-UI is added to the project. Both representations should use the same business logic and follow the same path though the system no matter if it is an API call or UI interaction with the server.
