Well this is my first post on a non software development topic and I would like to say happy birthday to my favourite podcast omegatau for their 10<a href="http://omegataupodcast.net/2012/08/100-system-health-mgt/" target="_blank">0th episode</a>. And I would like to thank Markus and Nora for this awesome project. I think my first episode was number <a href="http://omegataupodcast.net/2009/12/22-nuclear-fusion-at-mpi-fur-plasmaphysik/" target="_blank">22 </a>about nuclear fission in late 2009 and felt in love with it right at that point. In the following years there were so many awesome episodes that I would recommend you to listen to each of them, but as always I have some favourites. My all time favourite German Episode is number <a href="http://omegataupodcast.net/2011/03/58-komplexe-systeme-4/" target="_blank">58 </a>"Komplexe Systeme" which shows how to design complex systems without being complicated. Also the German episode number <a href="http://omegataupodcast.net/2011/05/65-eisenbahnsicherungstechnik/" target="_blank">65 â€“ Eisenbahnsicherungstechnik</a> is awesome.

My favourite English episodes are the two Apollo episodes (<a href="http://omegataupodcast.net/2011/12/83-how-apollo-flew-to-the-moon/" target="_blank">83 </a>and <a href="http://omegataupodcast.net/2012/06/97-how-apollo-explored-the-moon/" target="_blank">97</a>) those episodes really gave me a deep look into how Apollo worked and what hap pend up there. And the recent CERN episodes (<a href="http://omegataupodcast.net/2012/04/93-the-standard-model-of-particle-physics/" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="http://omegataupodcast.net/2012/05/94-neutrinos/" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="http://omegataupodcast.net/2012/05/95-antimatter/" target="_blank">3</a>, <a href="http://omegataupodcast.net/2012/06/96-controlling-the-lhc-beam/" target="_blank">4</a>) are damn good two and should give a pretty good impression how leading edge the LHC is.

So open your favourite pod-catcher and add <a href="http://omegataupodcast.net/">http://omegataupodcast.net/</a>
