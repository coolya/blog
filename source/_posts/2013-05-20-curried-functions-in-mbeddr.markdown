About a week ago I ranted on [google+][gp] about how to use the C preprocessor to create [curried functions][cf] in C and that it would be much easier with mbeddr. This weekend I had some spare time and created a sample. The first part about simple currying is quite simple since mbeddr already ships with closure support.
