After some month of low activity in the mbeddr.arduino repository I found more time to work on it in
the past week. It is now in a state that it is reasonable to release a first version of it. This version
contains a very fist look at the features available by mbeddr in combination with real hardware. If you
find any issues please report them on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/coolya/mbeddr.arduino/issues) or get in touch with me over the various social media links on the left or via Email. Also contributions and ideas for new features are highly welcome!

You can grab the current release from the github [release page](https://github.com/coolya/mbeddr.arduino/releases).
The [readme](https://github.com/coolya/mbeddr.arduino/blob/master/Readme.md) provides some detailed installation instructions for Linux, Mac and Windows.

Have fun hacking your Arduino with mebddr! :-)
