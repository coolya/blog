I am always open to experiemt with new stuff, so this time I did something I wanted to do for a long time: play a bit with <strong>F#</strong>. I read some book about it in the past, but never had the chance to really <strong>do</strong> something with it. I was always fascinated by the expressiv code that you are able to create with it. Since my current spare time poject is using a webserver I thought it would be a nice idea to implement some stuff for it with F#.

I am now rewriting the hole server component of the <a href="http://www.logv.ws/zugmonitor-app">trainmonitor</a> in F# to get a feeling for it. Here is the first part of code I wrote that is nothing more that a wrapper around the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Net.HttpListener.aspx">HttpListener</a> of the .Net framework. I have written similar stuff in C# to get a async event based <a href="https://github.com/coolya/Simple_Http">server</a> for C#, but what I alway felt ugly about was the way the controlflow was distibuted all over the place. Wouldn't it be nice to just write code like this:



<pre><code>server.Get |&gt;  Observable.add greeting
</code></pre>

Which simply replies "hello world" to any get request?

Ok this is a little trick since "greeting" is a function that does the hard work but even if I write it more verbose is looks like this:



<pre><code>server.Get |&gt;  Observable.add (fun(ctx) -&gt; response ctx |&gt; write "hello world" |&gt; close)
</code></pre>

Still quite nice? And even if you don't know much about the language or how the methods are implemented you can read whats going on.

It observes the servers "Get" event then it extracts the response, writes "hello world" and closes the response. Ok now how it works?

Lets have a look at the hole code:



<pre><code>open logv.http
[&lt;EntryPoint&gt;]
let main argv =     
    let server = new Server("localhost", 13337)

    server.Start()

    server.Get |&gt;  Observable.add (fun(ctx) -&gt; response ctx |&gt; write "hello world" |&gt; close)
    System.Console.ReadLine() |&gt; ignore
    server.Stop()
</code></pre>

The magic seems to happen in the logv.http module. This is a module written by me that offers some methods and a server class to interact with the HttpListener of the framework in a more sophisticated way. Due to the nature of F# and its lightwight syntax it offer sime kind of mirco domain specific language to work with. E.g. the "response" keyword is a function for real that extracts the response from a HttpListenerContext and the write function writes a string to such a response combined together it looks like they would be part of the language.

If you are interested in the hole code you can find it a the end of this post. Since I just started porting the code I will keep posting my experience in a small series of blog posts in the near future.



<pre><code>namespace logv 
     module http =
        open System.Net

        /// &lt;summary&gt;Extracts the response from HttpListenerContext&lt;/summary&gt;
        /// &lt;param name="ctx"&gt;The HttpListenerContext to extract the response from&lt;/param&gt;
        ///&lt;returns&gt;The HttpListenerResponse from the Context&lt;/returns&gt;
        let response (ctx : HttpListenerContext) = ctx.Response
        /// &lt;summary&gt;Extracts the reqeust from HttpListenerContext&lt;/summary&gt;
        /// &lt;param name="ctx"&gt;The HttpListenerContext to extract the request from&lt;/param&gt;
        ///&lt;returns&gt;The HttpListenerRequest from the Context&lt;/returns&gt;
        let request (ctx : HttpListenerContext) = ctx.Request
        let body (req : HttpListenerRequest) = async {
                let decode b = req.ContentEncoding.GetString(b)

                let stream = req.InputStream
                let! bytes = stream.AsyncRead((int)stream.Length)
                return decode bytes
            }



        let writeCode501 (res : HttpListenerResponse) =
            res.StatusCode &lt;- 501
            res

        let write (data : string) (res : HttpListenerResponse) =
            let bytes = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(data)
            let stream = res.OutputStream
            stream.Write(bytes, 0 , bytes.Length)
            res

        let requestUrl (ctx :HttpListenerContext) = ctx.Request.RawUrl
        let endsWith(pattern : string) (target : string) = target.EndsWith(pattern)
        let startsWith(pattern : string) (target : string) = target.StartsWith(pattern)
        let contains (pattern : string) (target : string)  = target.Contains(pattern)
        let matches (pattern : string) (target : string) = System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.IsMatch(target, pattern)


        let close (res : HttpListenerResponse) = res.Close()

        type Server(host : string, port : int) = class
            let cts = new System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource()
            let listener = new HttpListener()
            let getEvent = new Event&lt;_&gt;()
            let postEvent = new Event&lt;_&gt;()
            let putEvent = new Event&lt;_&gt;()
            let deleteEvent = new Event&lt;_&gt;()
            let patchEvent = new Event&lt;_&gt;()

            let handleContext(ctx :HttpListenerContext) =
                match ctx.Request.HttpMethod with
                | "GET" -&gt; getEvent.Trigger(ctx)
                | "POST" -&gt; postEvent.Trigger(ctx)
